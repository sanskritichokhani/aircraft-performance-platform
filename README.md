## What This Does
This platform integrates five engineering modules into a unified interactive dashboard:
| Module | What it computes |
|--------|-----------------|
| ISA Atmosphere | Temperature, pressure, density, speed of sound vs altitude |
| Aerodynamics | Drag polar, L/D ratio, minimum drag speed |
| Range Analysis | Breguet range equation, payload-range diagram |
| Flight Operations | Phase detection, specific energy analysis |
| Optimization | Altitude optimization, payload-fuel sensitivity, cruise Mach vs weight |
---
## Aircraft Supported
| Aircraft | MTOW | Design Range | Cruise Mach |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| Boeing 737-800 | 79,016 kg | ~5,765 km | M 0.785 |
| Airbus A320neo | 79,000 kg | ~6,300 km | M 0.780 |
| Boeing 777-300ER | 351,534 kg | ~13,650 km | M 0.840 |

## Engineering Approach
### Atmosphere Model
International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) covering troposphere (0–11,000 m)
and lower stratosphere, with correct isothermal layer above tropopause.
### Aerodynamic Model
Drag polar: `CD = CD0 + k·CL²`  
Induced drag factor derived from wing geometry: `k = 1/(π·AR·e)`  
Not hardcoded — computed from aircraft parameters.
### Range Model
Breguet range equation:  
`R = (V/TSFC) · (L/D) · ln(Wi/Wf)`
Key implementation decisions:
- TSFC in SI units: `kg/(N·s)` — common source of unit errors
- Mission initialized from defined payload + fuel load, not MTOW
- Wave drag correction above Mach 0.78 (Mcrit for narrow-body transports)
- Model validated: **4.4% error vs Boeing 737-800 published range**
### Optimization
- Cruise altitude sweep with thrust lapse approximation: `T/T_sl ≈ (ρ/ρ_sl)^0.7`
- Payload-fuel sensitivity: 400-point contour study showing MTOW constraint boundary
- Cruise Mach optimizer: `scipy.minimize_scalar` on Breguet range factor `V·(L/D)`
### Flight Phase Analysis
Automatic segmentation into ground / climb / cruise / descent phases
using vertical speed thresholds. Specific mechanical energy computed as:
`E = V²/2 + g·h` (J/kg)

## Model Limitations
This is a conceptual-level model. Known limitations:
- **No wind modeling** — assumes still air throughout
- **Constant TSFC** — real engines vary with throttle and altitude
- **Single cruise altitude** — no step-climb simulation
- **Thrust ceiling** — simplified lapse rate, not a full engine deck
- **No reserve fuel** — Breguet uses all loaded fuel
- **Incompressible aerodynamics** — wave drag is a simplified correction only
These limitations are consistent with conceptual design tools used in early
aircraft development phases.
